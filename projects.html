        <div class="project-card">
            <h2>1. Micro:bit Step Counter</h2>
            <p>
                Use the accelerometer to count your steps and display the total on the LED display. Track your steps throughout the day, and learn how sensors can detect motion. Enhance it with daily goals or track other physical activities.
            </p>              
        </div>

        <div class="project-card">
            <h2>2. Micro:bit Weather Station</h2>
            <p>
                Build a weather station that measures temperature and light levels using the sensors on the Micro:bit. Display this data on the LED grid, and learn how to create environmental monitoring systems. Ideal for weather-based projects or experiments.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-card">
            <h2>3. Micro:bit Digital Compass</h2>
            <p>
                Use the magnetometer to create a digital compass that shows direction (North, East, South, West) on the LED grid. This project teaches you about navigation, magnetism, and how sensors interact with the environment.
            </p>              
        </div>

        <div class="project-card">
            <h2>4. Micro:bit Rock-Paper-Scissors Game</h2>
            <p>
                Program a game of rock-paper-scissors that uses the shake gesture to choose a random move (rock, paper, or scissors). This project teaches you about randomness in programming and how to use the accelerometer for interactive games.
            </p>              
        </div>

        <div class="project-card">
            <h2>5. Micro:bit Mood Tracker</h2>
            <p>
                Create a mood tracker that logs your mood using button presses and displays emojis on the LED grid. This project helps you understand button inputs and how conditionals can be used to trigger different outcomes.
            </p>              
        </div>

        <div class="project-card">
            <h2>6. Micro:bit Communication with Radio</h2>
            <p>
                Use the radio feature to send and receive messages between multiple Micro:bits. This project teaches you about wireless communication and is great for creating multiplayer games or messaging systems.
            </p>              
        </div>

        <div class="project-card">
            <h2>7. Micro:bit Reaction Time Tester</h2>
            <p>
                Test your reaction time with this project that uses buttons and a random timer. When the signal appears on the LED grid, press the button as quickly as possible to measure your reaction speed. Learn about timing and sensor inputs in programming.
            </p>              
        </div>

        <div class="project-card">
            <h2>8. Micro:bit Traffic Light System</h2>
            <p>
                Simulate a traffic light system using LEDs and control the light sequence with loops and delays. Learn about timing, loops, and how systems can control outputs systematically, just like in real traffic lights.
